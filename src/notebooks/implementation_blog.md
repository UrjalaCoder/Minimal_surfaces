# Implementing the Minimal Surface Solver: From Theory to Code

In our previous post, we discussed the mathematical formulation of the minimal surface problem using differential forms. Now, let's dive into the implementation details and see how we can turn this elegant mathematical theory into working code.

## 1. The Core Components

Our implementation consists of several key components:

1. **Grid System**: A 3D periodic domain (torus) where we'll solve the problem
2. **Differential Forms**: Classes representing 0-forms and 1-forms with their operations
3. **Minimal Surface Solver**: The main class implementing the ADMM algorithm

Let's look at each component in detail.

### 1.1 The Grid System

The grid system is implemented in `grid.py` and provides a discretized representation of our periodic domain. Key features include:

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, resolution=32, bounds=[[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]]):
        # Creates a 3D grid with specified resolution and bounds
        # The grid is periodic, representing a 3D torus
```

The grid handles:
- Conversion between grid indices and spatial coordinates
- Periodic boundary conditions
- Efficient storage of grid points

### 1.2 Differential Forms

Our `DifferentialForm` class (in `differential_form.py`) implements the mathematical machinery we need:

```python
class DifferentialForm:
    def __init__(self, grid: Grid, form_degree: int = 0):
        # Creates a differential form of specified degree
        # form_degree=0 for scalar fields, form_degree=1 for vector fields
```

Key operations include:
- Exterior derivative (`differentiation()`)
- Hodge star operator
- Mass norm computation
- Integration and evaluation

## 2. The Minimal Surface Solver

The main solver class implements the ADMM algorithm to solve our optimization problem:

```python
class MinimalSurfaceSolver:
    def __init__(self, grid: Grid, boundary_curve: np.ndarray):
        # Initialize with grid and boundary curve
```

### 2.1 Initialization Steps

The solver starts by:
1. Computing the projected area vector A
2. Initializing η₀ that satisfies boundary conditions
3. Setting up ADMM parameters

### 2.2 The ADMM Algorithm

The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) breaks our problem into three steps:

1. **Update ϕ (scalar potential)**:
   - Solves a Poisson equation
   - Handles the boundary conditions

2. **Update z (auxiliary variable)**:
   - Implements the shrinkage operator
   - Enforces the mass norm constraint

3. **Update u (dual variable)**:
   - Updates the Lagrange multipliers
   - Ensures convergence

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Computing the Projected Area Vector

The projected area vector A is computed using:
```python
def _compute_projected_area(self) -> np.ndarray:
    # A = 1/2 ∮_Γ γ × dγ
    # Numerical integration along the boundary curve
```

### 3.2 Initializing η₀

The initial 1-form η₀ must satisfy:
1. Boundary condition: dη₀ = δ_Γ
2. Cohomology constraints: ∫_M dx_i ∧ ⋆η₀ = A_i

```python
def _initialize_eta_0(self) -> DifferentialForm:
    # Solves a Poisson equation with boundary conditions
    # Enforces cohomology constraints
```

### 3.3 ADMM Implementation

The main solver loop:
```python
def solve(self) -> DifferentialForm:
    # Initialize variables
    phi = DifferentialForm(self.grid, form_degree=0)
    z = DifferentialForm(self.grid, form_degree=1)
    u = DifferentialForm(self.grid, form_degree=1)

    for iteration in range(self.max_iter):
        # ADMM steps
        phi = self._update_phi(phi, z, u)
        z = self._update_z(phi, u)
        u = self._update_u(phi, z, u)
        
        if self._check_convergence(phi, z, u):
            break
```

## 4. Numerical Considerations

Several important numerical aspects need careful consideration:

1. **Discretization**:
   - Using central differences for derivatives
   - Handling periodic boundary conditions
   - Maintaining numerical stability

2. **Convergence**:
   - Choosing appropriate ADMM parameters
   - Implementing efficient convergence checks
   - Handling numerical errors

3. **Performance**:
   - Using Fast Fourier Transform for Poisson solves
   - Optimizing memory usage
   - Parallelizing computations where possible

## 5. Next Steps

In the next post, we'll:
1. Implement the core solver components
2. Add visualization capabilities
3. Test with various boundary curves
4. Optimize performance

Stay tuned for the implementation details and results!
