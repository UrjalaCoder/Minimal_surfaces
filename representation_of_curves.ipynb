    "Formally, a differential form $\\omega$ is defined as an alternating linear functional on the tangent bundle of some manifold.   \n",
    "Essentially, $\\omega$ \"eats\" one or more tangent vectors $v_i$ of the manifold at some point and spits out a scalar number $\\omega(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A $k$-differential form $\\omega$ \"eats\" $k$ tangent vectors.   \n",
    "The alternating property means that for any combination of tangent vectors $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ and for any $i, j \\leq n$ we have $\\omega(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_i, v_j, \\dots, v_n) = -\\omega(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_j, v_i, \\dots, v_n)$. Intuitively, this means that swapping any input vectors to the differential form introduces a sign change, this is related to how we can integrate differential forms to obtain measures of length, area and volume."
