    "# Discretizing the minimal surface problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous post, we explored how curves and surfaces can be represented using differential forms and Dirac delta distributions. We rewrote Plateau's problem — the search for a minimal surface spanning a given curve — as a variational problem over differential forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha = \\delta_\\Gamma$ and minimizes $\\|\\alpha\\|^2 = \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge *\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to make this computational.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we introduce the discretization approach developed by Wang and Chern. The core idea is to bring differential forms to the discrete setting using **Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC)** — a framework that mimics the operations of differential geometry on simplicial meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The computational domain\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by triangulating our 3D domain $M$, which contains the curve $\\Gamma$. This mesh is made up of tetrahedra, faces (triangles), edges, and vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEC assigns discrete differential forms to elements of this mesh:\n",
    "- **0-forms** live on vertices\n",
    "- **1-forms** live on edges\n",
    "- **2-forms** live on faces\n",
    "- **3-forms** live on tetrahedra\n",
    "\n",
    "![Discrete Form Assignment Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/DEC_duality.svg/600px-DEC_duality.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above shows how differential forms naturally align with different mesh elements. For our purposes, we’ll be working mainly with 1-forms (assigned to edges) and 2-forms (assigned to faces).\n",
    "\n",
    "## From continuous to discrete formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recall our continuous problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are given a smooth, closed curve $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$\n",
    "2. We want to find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that:\n",
    "   - $d\\alpha = \\delta_\\Gamma$\n",
    "   - $\\|\\alpha\\|^2 = \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge *\\alpha$ is minimized\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discrete setting, we replace:\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ → a vector of real numbers, one per oriented edge\n",
    "- $d \\alpha$ → a discrete exterior derivative operator $D$ (an incidence matrix from edges to faces)\n",
    "- $* \\alpha$ → a diagonal Hodge star matrix\n",
    "- $\\delta_\\Gamma$ → a discrete 2-form (vector on faces) approximating the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "We now translate our continuous problem into several intermediate discrete optimization problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem A (unconstrained formulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\alpha$ be any 1-form (edge-valued vector). Then the minimal surface problem becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_\\alpha \\ \\|\\alpha\\|^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad D\\alpha = \\delta_\\Gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quadratic optimization with a linear constraint. It can be solved using Lagrange multipliers or by projecting onto the constraint subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem B (reduced formulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, let $\\beta$ be any particular 1-form satisfying $D\\beta = \\delta_\\Gamma$. Then we can search for a correction $\\delta \\alpha$ in the kernel of $D$ that minimizes energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\delta \\alpha \\in \\ker D} \\ \\|\\beta + \\delta \\alpha\\|^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation highlights that the solution is unique up to a co-closed (divergence-free) component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem C (linear system form)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now write the Euler-Lagrange equations. The objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha^T * \\alpha\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the gradient and setting it to zero under the constraint $D \\alpha = \\delta_\\Gamma$, we arrive at the normal equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(*^{-1} D^T D) \\alpha = D^T *^{-1} \\delta_\\Gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core linear system we solve in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizing the result\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the discrete 1-form $\\alpha$, we can visualize the surface it encodes. One way is to reconstruct a vector field using the musical isomorphism and render streamlines or level sets. Another is to integrate $\\alpha$ over test paths and construct an approximate height function whose level set gives the minimal surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids parameterizations entirely. It works directly with the structure of the mesh and yields a surface as a flux-minimizing field — exactly what geometric measure theory seeks to describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next post, we'll show Python code for constructing such a DEC system and solving it on a simple mesh.\n"
